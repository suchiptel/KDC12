<h1>Respect for Parents</h1>
<p>Accepting this final lesson of love from his parents, Shantilal was now ready to take
the steps of renouncing home, family, friends and village. The gentle mother who would later say, "I would survive on seeing my Shanti. I lived for Shanti alone... "This was the same mother who was now lovingly preparing warm milk for Shantilal to drink prior to his departure from home. Placing her hands on his head, she gave blessings: "You are now going. Make sure you please Shastriji Maharaj and do as he says. Father Motibhai also gave his blessings: "Never ever leave Shastriji Maharaj. Whatever grief comes your way, tolerate it. But please Shastriji Maharaj at any cost.‚Äù Such was the ease and spontaneity of Shantilal mounting Ravjibhai's bicycle and gradually disappearing from the horizon of Chansad! </p>
